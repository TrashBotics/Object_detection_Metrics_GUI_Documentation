# OBJECT DETECTION: Evaluation Metrics 
### 1. Intersection over Union (IoU) ( Jaccard’s Index ) :
  Calculated by taking the intersection area of the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box and dividing by the union of the same. It provides a      numerical value that indicates how well the model’s prediction aligns with the actual object location.
